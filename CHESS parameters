game data -> Where 
x
for starters, all games of maybe only 5 to 10 players 

- year 
- elo opponent 
- elo self
- black or white 
- single position evaluation <-> just position evaluation or best 5 moves at depth x,y,z example top 5 moves at depths 1,5,15
- some information about the position itself : are queens on board / rooks on board 
- name (could add specific information but also lead to ambiguity if names are not uniform -> are they same indeed ?)

- no of legal moves 

- momentum <-> can be implemented after a base is set 
- *player type -> hoping to get from some other group ~ can be a similar parameter
